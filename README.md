# Overview

I am attemping to build a web app that allows me to add cards to my collection of cards and adds those cards to a deck.

I have a very basic structure of an app that allows me to add cards to a database.

I eventually want this app to be capable of managing my real decks that I own.

# Web Pages

The first webpage displays all of the cards that I have added to my collection. 

The second page shows the details of a given card that you choose.

I also have an admin page that will allow me to make changes and add cards to my collection.

# Development Environment

I used Django 4.1.5 and Python 10 in Visual Studio Code

I have downloaded and using boostrap

# Useful Websites

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro)
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/#add-bootstrap-to-your-app)

# Future Work

* Need to fix the problem of the database not working with the admin site correctly
* Change the display of the cards to be a smaller view
* Add a third page to add cards to a deck
